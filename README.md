For this project we have created a 'swamp cooler'. We have simulated the swamp cooler by using a cup of water as our resevoir and a stepper motor for vent direction control, and a motored fan for airflow. 

Components:
- Arduino Atmega 2560
- Breadboard
- Various Jumper Cables
- USB Cable
- Fan Blade
- 3.6 V Motor
- DHT 11 Temperature and Humidity Module
- Power Supply Module
- Green LED
- Yellow LED
- Red LED
- Various Resistors
- Liquid Crystal Display
- Water Level Detection Sensor Module
- Potentiometer

Challenges:
Along the lines of what we were unable to get to function properly were the DHT11 module, Liquid Crystal Display, and ISR buttons. However, we do have the code that supports the efforts we made to make all of these components work. Because of this, we are unable to reach a disabled state since the buttons are not functional.
