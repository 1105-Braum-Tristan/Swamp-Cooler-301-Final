For this project we have created a 'swamp cooler'. We have simulated the swamp cooler by using a cup of water as our resevoir and a stepper for vent direction control, and a motored fan as our blower. 

Components:
- Arduino Atmega 2560
- Breadboard
- A bunch of various colored wires
- USB Cable
- Fan Blade
- 3.6 V Motor
- DHT 11 Temperature and Humidity Module
- Power Supply Module
- Green LED
- Yellow LED
- Red LED
- Various Resistors
- Liquid Crystal Display
- Water Level Detection Sensor Module
- Potentiometer
